## Cluster 👯‍♀️

### What's the Cluster

A cluster is a way to group multiple shards together. It provides a mechanism to manage related state pieces collectively.

If you have many related shards you can create an object to store them in one place, like the example down below.

```tsx
import { shard, useCluster } from "shimmershards";
const nameShard = shard("John");
const ageShard = shard(18);
export const cluster = {
  useName: nameShard,
  useAge: ageShard,
};
```

### useCluster

To consume the states from a cluster you need to import a function named `useCluster` from shimmershards.
`useCluster` will take one parameter as a cluster object.
Then will give you back an object that contains a function to consume a state.

```tsx
const Component = () => {
  const { useName, useAge } = useCluster(cluster);
  const [name, setName] = useName();
  const [age, setAge] = useAge();

  return (
    <div>
      name: {name} age: {age}
    </div>
  );
};
```

The cluster object also can using by multiple components and all those states will sync.
