### Memo and Effect

`memo` and `effect` functions are tools to handle custom hooks.
When you work with a custom hook that shares state or functionality,
they won't necessarily use the same instance or cache. That's where memo and effect functions come in handy to address this problem.

#### memo

`memo` is a higher-order function that makes your custom function behave like an instance.

#### effect

`effect` is a function similar to` useEffect` that helps you manage dependencies provided to the function.

#### Caveats

To capture useEffect properly, use effect instead of useEffect. Remember that effect should be exclusively used within the memo function.

#### Example

```ts
import { memo, effect, shard, useShard } from "shimmershards";

const counterShard = shard(0);

export const useCounter = memo(() => {
  const [counter, setCounter] = useShard(counterShard);

  effect(() => {
    console.log(counter);
  }, [counter]);

  return { counter, setCounter };
});
```
