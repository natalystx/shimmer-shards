### Composing shards

In the library, there is no built-in function to directly combine shard states together. However, you can achieve
this by using either `useMemo` or `useEffect` from the React library.
You can simply combine state by manually merging the individual shard states as needed.

```tsx
const Component = () => {
  const [name, setName] = useShard(nameShard);
  const [age, setName] = useShard(ageShard);

  // using useMemo
  const user = useMemo(() => ({ name, age, active: true }), [name, age]);
  // or using useEffect
  const [userState, setUser] = useState({});
  useEffect(() => {
    setUser((prev) => ({ ...prev, name, age, active: true }));
  }, [name, age]);
};
```
